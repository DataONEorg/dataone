[DataONE](https://dataone.org) is a grass-roots, community-maintained federation of data repositories that strives for interoperability and open data access. 

This repository provides a general place for DataONE Discussion and Issue tracking across all of our products and services.

## :speech_balloon: Discussions

We use GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/DataONEorg/dataone/discussions) for any questions, idea sharing, and community discussion around issues of relevance to DataONE. Head on over and contribute to the conversation.

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/DataONEorg/dataone/issues) to track new feature requests, bug reports, and issues with DataONE products and services. Whether you have a new search filter to request for our [DataONE Data Search](https://search.dataone.org) or want to report a problem with our Metrics service, you can do so here. While each product and service have their own repositories as well, this centralized issue tracker provides a convenient place to report any issues for any DataONE product or service.  Thanks for your contributions!
